# HRData
Syntetic HR data creator

The code is used to generate a random dataset of Human Resource data. The data is complitelly systetic, but tries to mimic a genuine HR Data set typically found in commerical or non profit organizations. 

The data set should allow user to set parameters for the dataset.

During the development phase parameters are set as constants.
Currently the following parameters can be set:
_Number of employees
_Number of periods (in years)
_Gender bias on performance

An export module should be created to exprt the files as Txt files.
